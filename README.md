drake-echostep
==============

An example plugin for Drake. Illustrates how to extend Drake with a custom protocol.

Includes `src/drake/protoocol/echostep.clj`, an implementation of the `echostep`
protocol. The `echostep` protocol pretty prints all step data into the step's
 output file. So you can use this plugin to easily inspect Drake's step data
 model. Super handy when you're implementing your own protocol and need to know
 how to get out specific step data.

Includes `src/drake/fs/myfs.clj`, an implementation of a custom Drake FileSystem
called myfs.

This plugin has been deployed to Clojars. To use it, include the plugin in your
`plugins.edn` file in your Drake workflow dir. E.g.:
```clojure
{:plugins [[dirtyvagabond/drake-echostep "0.2.1"]]}
```

Then your Drake workflow can use the `echostep` protocol, e.g.:

```clojure
; Writes all step data to step.out.
; Assuming your workflow is in Drakefile:
; drake +=step.out
step.out <- [echostep +myopt]
  A command
  another command
  last command
```

Your workflow can also demonstrate using the myfs Filesystem, e.g.:

```clojure
; Writes the input filename to the output file
out.txt <- myfs:/A
  echo $INPUT > $OUTPUT
```

This project also implements `bandit-protocol` as a demonstration of bundling
more than one protocol implementation in a single plugin. It also demonstrates
setting the `no-cmds-required` option, as well as using a dash in your protocol
name. See `src/drake/bandit_protocol.clj`.
